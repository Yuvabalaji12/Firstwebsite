InstaFood is a comprehensive online platform allowing customers to order food from variousrestaurants. InstaFood also helps you promote your food business 
if you are new to the foodindustry and want a strong web presence. As a result, InstaFood bridges the gap between restaurant owners and customers.


While users pay a delivery fee, InstaFood earns through restaurants who pay a commission for each delivery, which is then split among the delivery partner and the company.
 Commissions from restaurants vary based on whether InstaFood is fulfilling the delivery or whether the restaurant uses its own riders.


Tracking tools: InstaFood is a food-delivery app that has built-in tracking tools. This means that you can see exactly where your food is at any point in the delivery process.
 You can also get real-time updates on the status of your order. This is useful if you're trying to plan your meal around when the food will arrive.
